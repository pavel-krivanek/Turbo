I am an abstract collection of bloc elements that can be mutated. I am used by a ${class:BlElement}$ to store its children.

I provide a data structure independent API for adding and removing children. I assume an index-based way of working with children. My subclasses wrap concrete data structures for storing the actual children. Bloc elements work with children only in terms of the API that I provide. Hence, I only provide a minimum API needed to work with children, instead of the full collection API.

I allow elements to optimize working with children for different scenarious. For example, an array for storing children optimises for accessing fast accesses at any position. A linked list optimize for fast adding and removing. A rope uses a balanced binary tree to support fast adding, removing and accessing, with the disadvantage of taking more memory.

!!API

The following subclasses can be used to store children: 
- ${class:BlChildrenArray}$: stores children using an ${class:Array}$ 
- ${class:BlChildrenLinkedList}$: stores children using a ${class:LinkedList}$  
- ${class:BlChildrenOrderedCollection}$: stores children using a ${class:OrderedCollection}$
- ${class:BlChildrenRope}$: stores children using a ${class:BlCollectionRope}$

Subclasses need to provide the implementation for methods adding and removing children.
